functionality

ncaa.pl <season - 16_17> <weights.dat> <teams.dat> <16_17_result.dat (optional)> <output.dat (optional)>

COMPLETED - barest functionality - weights.pl - generate list of weights

basic functionality - take a team name as input and output the stats from the data files

partial functionality - use stats to approximate the result of a game between two teams in input, adjusted for weights

full functionality - simulate the entire tournament with all possible weights and output the weights (ranked) that most accurately predict the tournament result.


how weights work
total weights of all (5?) stat collections must be 100%

1.0 = this ranking and nothing else is considered when determining the output
0.0 = this ranking is completely ignored when determining the output


script loops like this

(while possible weights remain)
	simulate the tournament
	compare simulated result to actual result
	give a score (accuracy %) to the simulated result and add a new line to output.dat
	adjust the starting weights (see "weight pattern example" below) and continue looping


theoretical improvements - once confident that play_game function using weights is behaving as intended, maybe add "fuzzyness":
simulate each set of weights X number of times and roll the dice on particularly close matchups.
